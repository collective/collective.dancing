# A content rules based scheduler
# content rule action to send as a newsletter - lets you pick channel to send to, and date to use to schedule
# a content rule filter to use a collector to determine (or could use collective.keywordcondition 1.0b1)
# can just use timed schedular.
# some how also need to pick a section to send to? or might have to include collector. Except that would be confusing
# as email will go to everyone regardless.

# e.g
# 1. object published
# 2. triggers rule
# 3. item is in collector results
# 4. effective date used to schedule
# 5. use send as newsletter, schedule and don't include collector results



# or
# every minute schedular
# modify collectors to pick a que field (instead of modified it might be start or effective
# also don't store the queue unless an item actually matched. This will help by reducing transactions.
# this will have the side effect that if an event moves its date into the past it can get triggered.
# it also means it runs all teh searches on every trigger for every subscriber, which isn't very efficient
